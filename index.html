        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>I’m Farren’s domain, 
          How do you do~
          There’s not much here,
          But isn’t that cool too?
          
          Her portfolio is elsewhere
          So here lies in lieu
          some words, arranged carefully.
          Me!—her precious WWW.
          
          There are no ads here
          And no products sold either
          No donations solicited
          Just thoughts and whitespace breather
          
          So take your time here
          And let the emptiness stew.
          Try not to think of other sites
          Like ones I don’t live up to.
          ‘Cause here, little ol’ me will have to do..</p>
